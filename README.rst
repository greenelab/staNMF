staNMF
------
Python 2.7 implementation of `Siqi Wu et al.'s 2016 stability NMF (staNMF)
<http://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1521171113>`_

Package Contents
----------------

=========
staNMF.py
=========
staNMF.py class includes the necessary methods to perform stability
NMF on a user-specified .csv datase (see sourcecode/staNMF_Example for precise
usage instructions)

=================
staNMF_Example.py
=================
Example of staNMF demonstrated on Wu et al.'s 2016
drosophila spatial expression data between K=15 and K=30; Generates
sample factorizations, calculates instability index, and plots instability
against K

============================
data/WuExampleExpression.csv
============================
sample dataset


Installation
-------------
$ pip install staNMF

*Please note that staNMF requires SPAMs package(version 2.5), which is
